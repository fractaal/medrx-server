THE GENERICS PHARMACY (TGP) started out as small pharmaceutical company in 1949. Acknowledging the dire need for quality medicines but at affordable prices, the company focused on generic medicines to provide the Filipino with a more affordable alternative.

In 2001, the company ventured into retail, starting only with a single outlet. As demand grew, the company decided to bring their medicines more accessible to all the far reaches of the country through the FRANCHISING business model. The historic year was 2007, starting with 20 outlets within Metro Manila.

Now as TGP, it revolutionized the entire Pharmaceutical healthcare industry and pharmaceutical retail with its bold and different path for growth. Who would think that a pharmacy or a drugstore with pure generic drugs rapidly take off? After the initial struggles and birth pains, the healthcare landscape has embraced and accepted generic medicine as it has proven to be effective and of high quality standards and yet, truly affordable for every Juan.

Now only on its 10th year in full pharmacy retail and franchising, TGP has dotted the entire archipelago with more than 1900 strong outlets, making healthcare accessible to every Filipino. As expansion grew rapidly, so with the numerous awards and recognition TGP received from various entrepreneurship, retail, franchising and marketing organizations. This is solid proof that TGP is now well accepted and trusted as source of quality and affordable generic medicines. The massive reach and accessibility made TGP a friendly neighborhood pharmacy outlet. TGP is now the largest retail pharmacy chain in the country.

We carry on with the vision to hit 2000 strong outlets to serve the Filipino.
